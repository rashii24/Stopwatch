*The 'setInterval()' method calls a function at specified interval of time (in milliseconds, 1 second = 1000 milliseconds.).
It continues calling the function until clearInterval() is called, or the window is closed.
Syntax:                      setInterval(function, milliseconds, param1, param2, ...)
where, function(Required): The function to execute.
milliseconds(Required): The execution interval.
param1, param2, ...	(Optional): Additional parameters to pass to the function.

It returns a number which is an id of the timer.
Use this id with 'clearInterval()' to cancel the timer.

*Time units conversion:
1000 ms = 1 s
60 s = 1 min
60 min = 1 hr
So whenever a varible containing milisecond reach upto 1000,
second's variable get incremented by one(1) &
again a cycle of milisecond starts from zero.
Similar for seconds, minutes & hours respectively.

*The 'conditional (ternary) operator' is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: 
1.a 'condition' followed by a question mark (?), then 
2.an 'expression' to execute if the condition is 'true' followed by a colon (:), and finally 
3.the 'expression' to execute if the condition is 'false'. 
Syntax:               condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse
This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an 'if...else' statement.


*The 'clearInterval()' method clears a timer set with the setInterval() method.
It terminates the execution of function specified by setInterval().
To clear an interval, use the id returned from setInterval().
syntax:              clearInterval(int);
